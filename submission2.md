## Task 1: Understanding Version Control Systems

### Steps and Outputs

- Created a test file `test_task1.txt` and made two commits:
- First commit: "Add test file for Task 1" (hash: 9257cf6)
- Second commit: "Update test file for Task 1" (hash: f8e91c4)

- Inspected objects using `git cat-file -p`:

- **Commit Object** (e.g., `f8e91c4`):
      ```

     Update test file for Task 1
      ```

     **Explanation**: This represents the commit metadata, including the tree hash, parent commit hash, author and committer details (name, email, timestamp), SSH signature, and commit message. The timestamp (1749552721) corresponds to June 4, 2025, 17:45:21 EEST.

- **Tree Object** (e.g., `8fd83d6e34ab96b5e7e8571e373999dad73833bc`):
      ```
     100644 blob af7fda8ea32b60578a1103ce061a50d7f6f09a35    README.md
     100644 blob 7a94f7af59b8968be392288ea03179a24ffc9d9e    lab1.md
     100644 blob 2f8463cc188ec6ca69ae7a0f98d38e132280becb    lab2.md
     100644 blob cb9cabe4b4336f314946b70d4fdb9ba770468c55    submission1.md

      ```
     **Explanation**: This represents the directory structure, listing files and their corresponding blob hashes.

- **Blob Object** (e.g., `3fa1dad2609a5b8f43224d51a530cd4564b52373`):
      ```
     Ã¿Ã¾This is a test file for Lab 2 Task 1
     Second line for Task 1
      ```
     **Explanation**: This represents the raw content of the file `test_task1.txt`.

### Conclusion

 Git stores data as a series of objects: commits (metadata), trees (directory structure), and blobs (file contents), all identified by unique SHA-1 hashess

## Task 2: Practice with Git Reset Command

### Steps and outputs
* Crated a series of commits:
     * First commit: 'First commit' (hash:e916d3)
     * Second commit: 'Second commit' (hash:61f27db)
     * Third commit: 'Third commit' (hash:b4c9c04)
* Used *git reset --soft HEAD~1*:
     This reset moved the HEAD to the previous commit (61f27db), keeping changes from "Third commit" in the staging area.
* Used *git reflog* to recover
     e91b6d3 HEAD@{0}: reset --hard HEAD~1: moving to e91b6d3
     b4c9c04 HEAD@{1}: commit: Third commit
     61f27db HEAD@{2}: commit: Second commit
     e91b6d3 HEAD@{3}: commit: First commit
showed the history of HEAD movements, allowing recovery of the "Third commit" state by resetting to b4c9c04.
* Used *git log *
     b4c9c04 (HEAD -> lab2) Third commit
     61f27db Second commit
     e91b6d3 First commit

**Conclusion**
git reset --soft keeps changes in the staging area, git reset --hard discards them, and git reflog helps recover lost commits.

## Task 3: Visualizing Git Commit History

### Steps and Outputs

* Created a series of commits on branch lab2:
     * Commit A (hash: 34ffeb3)
     * Commit B (hash: 8f8ff35)
     * Commit C (hash: 5c7db52)

* Created a new branch side-branch and made a commit:
     * Side branch commit (1cc3d77)

![alt text](image.png)
* 5c7db52 (HEAD -> lab2) Commit C
* 8f8ff35 Commit B
* 34ffeb3 Commit A
* 8d129c9 (origin/lab2) Update submission2.md with Task 2 steps
* 9f44fad Update submission2.md with Task 2 steps
* b4c9c04 Third commit
* 61f27db Second commit
* e91b6d3 First commit

![alt text](image-1.png)
* 1cc3d77 (side-branch) Side branch commit
* 5c7db52 (HEAD -> lab2) Commit C
* 8f8ff35 Commit B
* 34ffeb3 Commit A
* 8d129c9 (origin/lab2) Update submission2.md with Task 2 steps
* 9f44fad Update submission2.md with Task 2 steps

* List of Commit Messages

     * Commit A
     * Commit B
     * Commit C
     * Side branch commit

Reflection
Visualizing the commit graph helps understand the branching structure and collaboration flow, making it easier to track contributions and resolve merge conflicts in team projects.

## Task 4: Tagging a Commit

* Steps and Outputs
     * Tagged the latest commit as v1.0.0:
     Tag name: v1.0.0 Associated commit hash: b4c9c04
* Created an additional commit and tagged as v1.1.0:
     * Tag name: v1.1.0 Associated commit hash: 8d53549
![alt text](image-2.png)
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
Explanation
Tagging is valuable in software development for versioning releases, triggering CI/CD pipelines, and maintaining clear release notes.

## Bonus Task: GitHub Social Interactions ðŸŒŸ

* Steps and Outputs

     * Starred the course repository inno-devops-labs/Sum25-intro.
     * Followed the professor, TAs, and at least 3 classmates on GitHub.

Reflection
GitHub's social features, like starring and following, foster collaboration by connecting developers, helping discover projects, and building a community in open source or team-based projects.
