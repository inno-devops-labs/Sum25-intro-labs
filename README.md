11. Software Distribution: Gain insights into software distribution strategies and best practices.
12. Monitoring, Observability & Logging: Concepts of observability vs monitoring, metrics/logs/traces. Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK stack, OpenTelemetry.

## Lab Instructions and Grading

To ensure hands-on learning, this course includes practical labs. Each lab has specific tasks that need to be completed for grading purposes. The labs contribute 80% to your final grade, while a final exam accounts for the remaining 20%.

Here are some guidelines and rules for lab submissions:

- You need to submit each lab and achieve a minimum score of 6/10 to pass the course.
- Attending all lectures, practices, and submitting all lab assignments exempts you from the final exam and earns you extra points.
- To create a lab submission, create a new branch in your forked repository specifically for that lab.
- Complete the lab tasks in your branch and submit a pull request (PR) to the main branch of the course repository.
- Only the last commit of your PR before the deadline will be checked and graded.
- The deadline for lab submissions will be discussed and communicated.

## Grading and Grades Distribution

The course grading is as follows:

- Labs: 80% of the final grade.
- Final Exam: 20% of the final grade.

The grade ranges are as follows:

- [90-100] - A
- [75-90) - B
- [60-75) - C
- [0-60) - D

Each lab is marked out of 10 points. Completing the main tasks correctly will earn you the maximum of 10 points. However, if you're short on time or unable to complete all tasks, you can still achieve a minimum of 6 points by completing a subset of tasks.

## Submission Policy

It's essential to submit your lab results on time to maximize your grading. Late submissions will receive a maximum score of 6 points for the corresponding lab. Remember, submitting all labs is a requirement to pass the course successfully.

We look forward to embarking on this DevOps learning journey together and helping you build valuable skills for your career.
