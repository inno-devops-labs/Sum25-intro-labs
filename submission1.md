# Task 1: SSH Commit Signature Verification

## Benefits of Signing Commits

Signing commits with SSH keys ensures the authenticity and integrity of code contributions. It verifies that the commit was made by the claimed author, preventing unauthorized changes. This is crucial in collaborative projects to build trust, track contributions accurately, and enhance security by allowing verification of commit origins and detecting tampering.
