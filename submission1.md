**Commit signing provides essential security benefits:**
- Author verification - confirms commits are genuinely from the claimed author.
- Data integrity - ensures commit content hasn't been tampered with.
- Protection against impersonation - prevents malicious commits under someone else's identity.
- Security compliance - meets enterprise security requirements.
- Team trust - builds confidence in code authenticity.

**Strategy Comparison:**

*Standard Merge**
Creates a merge commit combining two branches. Preserves complete history and clearly shows integration points, but can create complex commit graphs.

*Squash and Merge*
Combines all feature branch commits into a single commit. Results in clean linear history but loses detailed development context, making debugging harder.

*Rebase and Merge*
Replays feature commits on top of the target branch. Creates clean history while preserving individual commits, but rewrites history and can complicate collaboration.

*Why the standard merge strategy is often preferred in collaborative environments:*
Standard merge is preferred in collaborative environments because it maintains full context without rewriting history. 
This approach supports better debugging, easier rollbacks, and clearer integration tracking. Most CI/CD tools are optimized for merge commits, 
and the complete history helps with code reviews and project understanding.
