# Task 2

Using `git checkout -b git-reset-practice` a new branch was created

Then a `file.txt` was created and modified through three commits

### git reset --soft HEAD~1

This command put the HEAD one commit behind while keeping the changes in the staging area, so that they can be commited again with or without change.

### git reset --hard HEAD~1

This command put the head one commit behind and also removed all the changes from the staging area and the working directory.

### git reset --hard <reflog_hash>

`git log --graph`'s visualization of the commit and branching history helps one understand how repository branches and how these branches later merge together, which can be helpful for a collaborative project. It helps seeing repository's structure and to understand the commit history more clearly.
