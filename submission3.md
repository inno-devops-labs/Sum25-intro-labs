# Task 1: Create Your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

1. By following Quickstart I created proposed demo GitHub action: `.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml` that triggers on every push to the repository.
2. Key concepts learned:

- Workflows: Automated processes defined in YAML files
- Events: Triggers like push or pull_request
- Jobs: Sets of steps that run on the same runner
- Runners: Machines that execute jobs (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted)
- Actions: Reusable units of code for common tasks
