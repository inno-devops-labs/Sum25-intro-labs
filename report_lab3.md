# CI Lab/CD - GitHub Actions

As part of the first task, I successfully set up the basic GitHub Actions workflow.

The steps I followed for task "Task 1: Creating the first GitHub Actions Pipeline":

1. Created a configuration file for the workflow in YAML format.
2. Set up a trigger to automatically start the workflow when making changes to the main branch.
3. Added steps to verify the source code and output the message.

git action: 

-   https://github.com/Kulikova-A18/Sum25-intro-labs/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml

The steps I have completed for the task "Task 2: Collecting system information and running manually":

1. I enabled a trigger to manually start the workflow, which allowed me to run it as needed.
2. Added steps to collect system information and operating system characteristics.

git action: 

-   https://github.com/Kulikova-A18/Sum25-intro-labs/blob/master/.github/workflows/manual-trigger.yml

In addition, a separate repository was created, where the c++ code is assembled, as well as running tests.:

- successful completion of the test
- a test that crashes on purpose and fails with an error

the repository:
