# Virtualization Lab

In this lab, you will learn how to deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox and customize its settings. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: VM Deployment

**Objective**: Install VirtualBox and deploy a new VM using Ubuntu.

1. **Install VirtualBox**:
   - Download and install VirtualBox from the official [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
   - Provide the version number of VirtualBox in your report.

2. **Deploy a Virtual Machine**:
   - Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox and choose the Ubuntu operating system.
   - Customize the VM settings, such as the allocated memory, number of CPU cores, and network configuration.
   - Document the steps you followed to deploy the VM, including any specific configurations you made.
   - Take a screenshot of the VM running and include it in your report.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create a `submission5.md` file.
   - Include the VirtualBox version number.
   - Document the steps and configurations made during the VM deployment.
   - Add a screenshot of the running VM in the `submission5.md` file.

## Task 2: System Information Tools

**Objective**: Discover and use command-line tools to display system information of the VM.

1. **Processor, RAM, and Network Information**:
   - Research and discover a suitable command-line tool for displaying processor, RAM, and network information separately.
   - Install the tool on your VM if needed.
   - Use the tool to display the processor, RAM, and network information of the VM.
   - Document the name of the tool, the command(s) used, and provide the output in `submission5.md` in the lab folder.

2. **Operating System Specifications**:
   - Research and discover a suitable command-line tool for displaying the operating system specifications.
   - Install the tool on your VM if needed.
   - Use the tool to display the operating system specifications of the VM.
   - Document the name of the tool, the command(s) used, and provide the output in the same `submission5.md` file.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure `submission5.md` contains:
     - Names of the tools used for each type of system information.
     - Commands used to display the information.
     - Outputs of the commands.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore VM deployment using VirtualBox and discover suitable command-line tools for displaying system information to gain insights into hardware specifications and operating system details.
