Task 1: Benefits of Signed Commits

Authentication of the author

Guaranteed code integrity

Protection against commit spoofing

Compliance with security requirements

Task 2: Comparison of Merge Strategies

Strategy	          Pros	                                     Cons
Standard Merge	          Preserves change history	             Creates "noise" in history
Squash Merge	          Clean commit history	                     Loses change context
Rebase	                  Linear history	                     Rewrites history (dangerous!)


Why Standard Merge is Preferred:

Transparency of change history
Safety (doesnâ€™t overwrite commits)
Convenience for troubleshooting
